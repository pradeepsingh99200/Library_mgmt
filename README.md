A simple web-based Library Management System built with Django and integrated with the Frappe to import books. This app helps a librarian manage books, members, transactions, and rental fees efficiently.
- Add, view, and manage books and members.
- Issue books to members and track their returns.
- Automatically calculate rent fees on book returns.
- Import book data using the public [Frappe Library API]
No login system is implemented to keep the app focused and simple as per instructions.

**Note** :- 
I haven’t used a database in this project, so the data is not being stored permanently. Due to some issues related to database setup, 
I’ve used local storage as a temporary solution for handling data.
